# Flask Frontend

This project serves as the frontend for the `MediaConverterApp`, an application that processes various types of media files, including:

- Video files;
- Image files;
- Audio files.

`MediaConverterApp` is built using a microservice architecture, which makes it easy to scale. For instance, adding a new frontend application like a Telegram bot or introducing a new backend service for processing additional file types is straightforward.

# Overall Structure

The application follows a microservice architecture where components communicate using different protocols:

- All client requests from the frontend are forwarded to the API Gateway via HTTP, where further actions are performed.
- Microservices communicate with the API Gateway using gRPC.
